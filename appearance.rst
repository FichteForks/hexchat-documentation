HexChat comes with built in icons for the tray, user list, and channel tree. You can use custom icons by placing icons (16x16 recommended) in an :file:`icons` subdir, which may need to be created, within your `config folder <settings.html#config-files>`_. The icons must be named as follows:

- User List
	- ulist_netop.png
	- ulist_founder.png
	- ulist_owner.png
	- ulist_op.png
	- ulist_halfop.png
	- ulist_voice.png
- Channel Tree
