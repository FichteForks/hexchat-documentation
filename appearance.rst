Theme Manager
-------------

The theme manager is a simple external application, which is included with the installer on Windows and buildable on Linux, that helps install themes.

The themes are distributed as :file:`.htc` files. These are just simply ZIP archives that you can extract manually. Some themes can be found `here <http://dl.hexchat.org/themes/>`_.

.. NOTE::
	.NET 4 is required to run the theme manager; You can download it `here <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17113>`_

Icons

HexChat comes with built in icons for the tray, user list, and channel tree. You can use custom icons by placing icons (16x16 recommended) in an :file:`icons` subdir, which may need to be created, within your `config folder <settings.html#config-files>`_. The icons must be named as follows:
