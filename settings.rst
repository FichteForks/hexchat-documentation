Config Files
------------

Config files are stored as plaintext files (which shouldn't be edited by hand). They are located in:

- Windows: :file:`%APPDATA%\\HexChat`
- Unix: :file:`~/.config/hexchat`

.. NOTE::
   Type the path into your file browser to expand them into a full directory.

On Windows there is a portable mode option which makes HexChat store settings inside of a :file:`\\config` subdir within the main installation folder. Though this option should only be used if you must for a portable drive or if you lack administrative priviliges for installation.
